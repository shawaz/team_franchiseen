## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Consistent Architecture Patterns

1. **Route Structure**: All pages follow `/section/subsection` pattern
2. **Component Structure**: Each page uses the established Card-based UI
3. **Data Layer**: Convex queries and mutations for all data operations
4. **Authentication**: Clerk integration with role-based permissions
5. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

### Shared Components to Create

```typescript
// Core reusable components needed across all sections
- DataTable with sorting, filtering, pagination
- StatsCard for KPI displays
- ActionModal for create/edit operations
- FilterPanel for advanced filtering
- ExportButton for data export
- SearchBar with advanced search capabilities
- StatusBadge for various status indicators
- ProgressBar for tracking completion
- DateRangePicker for time-based filtering
- BulkActionToolbar for batch operations
```

### Database Schema Additions

```typescript
// Core tables needed for most sections
permissions: {
  userId: Id<"users">,
  section: string,
  actions: string[], // ["read", "write", "delete", "admin"]
  createdAt: number
}

auditLog: {
  userId: Id<"users">,
  action: string,
  section: string,
  entityId: string,
  changes: any,
  timestamp: number
}

notifications: {
  userId: Id<"users">,
  type: string,
  title: string,
  message: string,
  isRead: boolean,
  createdAt: number
}
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for all admin sections
2. **Caching**: Use Convex's built-in caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Pagination**: Implement server-side pagination for large datasets
4. **Search**: Use Convex's search capabilities for text-based queries
5. **Real-time Updates**: Leverage Convex's real-time subscriptions

### Security & Permissions

1. **Role-Based Access**: Implement granular permissions per section
2. **Data Isolation**: Ensure users only see data they have access to
3. **Audit Trail**: Log all administrative actions
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs on both client and server
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

## üìã Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Focus on Operations/Franchise as the highest priority
2. **Create Shared Components**: Build the reusable component library first
3. **Set up Database Schema**: Add the necessary Convex schemas
4. **Implement Authentication**: Set up role-based permissions
5. **Build Core Features**: Focus on essential functionality before advanced features
6. **Test Thoroughly**: Implement comprehensive testing for each section
7. **Gather Feedback**: Get user feedback after each phase completion
8. **Iterate and Improve**: Continuously improve based on user needs

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing all admin sections while prioritizing business-critical functionality first.
